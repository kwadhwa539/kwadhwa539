### Working on your repo, in VS Code.

Created on my local machine, using VS Code.

The steps to work on your local machine, make changes in your repo and push them, all of these inside VS Code are:-
1. Press `ctrl+shift+p` to open command prompt inside vsc. 
2. Type `clone`, and paste your repo link.
3. Open the repo. It will show you all the files and folders in the repo.
4. Do the required changes. Just beside the changed files, it will show a `U` or `M` letter, meaning it is untracked. 
5. Call command prompt again using the above shortcut and type `commit`, type the commit message and hit enter.
6. To push your commits, open c-pmt and type `sync` and hit enter.

That's it!
