## Blog 1

Hey there! This is my first blog on Github pages(on any platform actually). I think, I will write this as an Introduction blog?

I am currently doing my BTech in Civil Eng. from VJTI. I am a member of this club, SRA which consists of programming, development, robotics, yada yada yada.
I kinda like the minimal design of git, hence thought to give gh pages a shot. I like writing...things, thoughts, etc.
